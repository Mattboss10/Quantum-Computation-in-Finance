Variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs) are algorithms that use quantum computers to solve complex problems in chemistry and physics. 
They work by finding the lowest energy state, or ground state, of a given system using a trial wavefunction. 
The algorithm prepares this trial wavefunction(Î¨)-a mathematical function that describes the behavior of a particle, and measures its energy, and updates it until it converges to the ground state energy of the system. 
This can help solve problems that are too difficult for classical computers, such as simulating the behavior of complex molecules or materials, which has important applications in drug discovery, materials science, and other fields such as finance
